soundclick recording backend example
------------------------------------

Example PyNest script to demonstrate the soundclick recording backend.

Recorded spike events produce a clicking sound similar to that heard in
electrophysiological recordings. The recording backend makes use of the
SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) audio module.
This requires libsfml-dev to be installed. To create the illusion of a
realistic sound from an electrophysiological recording, the recording
backend slows down the simulation to biological real time.
